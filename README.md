# Noty

Sticky notes that live at the edge of your screen. A native macOS app in Swift,
SwiftUI and AppKit.

No dock icon, no window to manage. Slide the pointer to the right edge and the
deck fans out.

## Personal fork: fonts, themes, and Homebrew

This is a personal fork of [aimen08/noty](https://github.com/aimen08/noty), with
any installed font selectable through the macOS font panel and five themes:
Follow macOS, Light, Dark (default), Sepia, and Nord.

```sh
brew tap inurun/noty https://github.com/inurun/noty.git
brew install --cask inurun/noty/noty-local
```

Requires macOS 15 or later. The release ZIP supports Apple Silicon and Intel;
no local build is needed. [Download the personal fork](https://github.com/inurun/noty/releases/latest).
The screenshots below show the original light appearance.

Quit any existing Noty before installing. A manually installed Noty must be
moved to Trash first. Notes and settings are retained; do not run both copies
at once. This app is ad-hoc signed, so macOS may require first-launch approval
in System Settings → Privacy & Security.

Update with `brew update` followed by `brew upgrade --cask noty-local`.
The personal fork does not include Sparkle or fetch upstream app updates.

| At rest | Fanned | A note pulled open |
|---|---|---|
| ![The deck at rest: a thin pill of coloured dashes on the screen edge](screenshots/rest.png) | ![The deck fanned into shingled paper tabs](screenshots/fan.png) | ![A note pulled clear of the deck, carrying its tab down the left side](screenshots/open.png) |

## Three states, one movement

| State | What you see | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| **Rest** | A 12 pt pill on the screen edge — one coloured dash per note | idle |
| **Fan** | Notes shingle down the edge 45 ms apart as vertical tabs, each keeping its colour and carrying its label turned on its side | pointer enters the pill |
| **Expanded** | The note slides clear of the deck at full size, level with its own tab, which stays visible behind it | click a tab |

The deck shows **five notes at a time** and puts the rest behind a `+N` tab, which
opens the full list in a scrolling deck. A `+` button sits in the bottom corner
while the deck is open.

Tabs **shingle**: each one is full height but sits only a strip below the one
before, lapping over it like a roof tile. That is what keeps the deck to roughly
half the screen height instead of running its full length. The strip is sized to
the longest title currently on the deck, so labels read in full and ellipsise
cleanly rather than being clipped mid-word.

The fan is only 56 pt wide, so the deck covers almost none of what is behind it.

### Two deck styles

Right-click the pill → **Deck style**:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Labelled tabs** | Full-size tabs carrying their titles — the default |
| **Colour chips** | Colour only, no labels; the deck shrinks to a row of chips |

The open note carries its own tab along as a left gutter, separated by a dashed
rule, so it reads as growing out of the deck rather than floating beside it.

**Deck size** scales every metric off one multiplier — tab width, the lap between
tabs, the label type, the chips and the resting pill — so the deck grows without
drifting out of proportion with itself. Settings → Deck → *Size* (70–180%), or
right-click the pill → *Deck size* for the four presets.

**Keep deck open** makes the fan the resting state instead of the pill, so the
tabs and their labels stay on the edge without being hovered first. Off by
default; notes still open, close and idle away exactly as before.

## Automation

Noty registers the `noty://` URL scheme, so Shortcuts, Raycast, Alfred or a
terminal can talk to it:

```sh
open "noty://new?text=Buy%20milk"   # create a note with this text
open "noty://capture"               # open the quick-capture box
open "noty://all"                   # the All Notes window
open "noty://settings"              # Settings
```

The text only ever becomes note content — nothing in a URL is executed.

## Shortcuts

All of these are listed in Settings (`⌘,`), and the first four can be rebound
there. Global ones are registered through the Carbon hotkey API, so **no
Accessibility permission is required**:

| | |
|---|---|
| `⌥⌘N` | new note (opens it straight away) |
| `⇧⌘Space` | quick capture — jot without opening the editor |
| `⌥⌘A` | All Notes |
| `⌥⌘L` | the Archive window |

Inside a note:

| | |
|---|---|
| `Esc` | close the note, back to the tabs (or dismiss the find bar) |
| `⌘F` | find in note |
| `⌘.` | cycle its colour |
| `⌘T` | turn the current line into a task, or strip the checkbox off |
| `⌘⌫` | delete, with ten seconds to undo |
| `⇧⌘A` | archive the note you are looking at |
| — | every shortcut here can be rebound in Settings |
| `⌘P` | pin the note so it stays open |
| `⌃+` / `⌃-` | bigger / smaller note text |

Standard editing (`⌘C` / `⌘V` / `⌘Z` / `⌘A`) works everywhere — the app builds a
main menu at launch purely so those key equivalents dispatch, even though an
accessory app draws no menu bar.

## Checkbox tasks

Any line can be a task. `⌘T` (or the checklist button in a note's header) puts a
checkbox on the current line; **click the box to tick it off** and the line is
struck through and dimmed. Return carries the list on to the next task, and
Return on an empty task ends the list.

Tasks live inline in the note body as `☐` / `☑` prefixes, so a note stays plain
text. Markdown export writes them as standard `- [ ]` / `- [x]` task syntax and
import reads that back. All Notes shows a `done/total` count per note.

## Everything else

- **Archived, not deleted.** Archiving pulls a note out of the deck but keeps it
  in All Notes → Archive, restorable at any time.
- **Quick capture** (`⇧⌘Space`) — a small floating box from anywhere: type,
  hit `↩`, and it becomes a note in the deck without opening the editor.
  `⇧↩` for a new line, `esc` to cancel, click away to dismiss. A row of
  chips picks the destination — a fresh note, or appended to the end of an
  existing one (`⌘1` for new, `⌘2`… for the tabs); the box's paper colour
  previews where the text will land.
- **All Notes** (`⌥⌘A`) — one window, search across every note body and title,
  with an editable detail pane.
- **Bidirectional text** — each note can follow its content automatically or be
  forced left-to-right or right-to-left from the direction menu in its header.
  The choice also applies in the All Notes editor and survives archive exports.
- **Multi-display & relocation** — show the deck on all displays, only the main
  screen, or a specific monitor. Hold `⌥ Option` and drag the pill to dock it to
  any edge, height, or display. Displays are tracked by `CGDirectDisplayID`, so
  hot-plugging rebuilds the decks with graceful fallback.
- **Over full-screen apps** — right-click the pill → *Show over full-screen apps*.
  This raises the panel to `.statusBar` level; `.floating` alone does not draw
  over a full-screen space.
- **Autosave** 250 ms after you stop typing, and again on close.
- **Settings** (`⌘,`, the cog under the deck's `+`, or right-click the pill) —
  four tabs. *Shortcuts* rebinds all twelve. *Deck* covers style, size, which
  display carries it, the edge, how far from it the pointer wakes the deck, and
  whether the tabs stay out. *Notes* has the face, text size, note size and
  Markdown. *Updates* shows the version, when it last checked, and checks now.
  Everything applies immediately.
- **Open on hover.** Off by default: turn it on and resting the pointer on a tab
  opens that note without a click.
- **Tab preview on hover.** Rest on any tab to peek at a flyout card showing its
  title, checklist progress and content snippet without opening the full note.
  Turning on open-on-hover replaces it — the note itself opens instead.
- **Markdown as you type.** `# headings`, `**bold**`, `*italic*`, `` `code` ``,
  `~~struck~~`, `> quotes`, `- bullets` and `[links](https://example.com)` are
  styled in place. Markers are hidden on every line but the one the caret is on,
  which shows them dimmed so they can still be edited — the stored text is
  exactly what you typed and exports unchanged.
- **⌘-click a link to open it.** A plain click still places the caret, since a
  note is a thing you edit first. Only `http`, `https` and `mailto` are ever
  made clickable; anything else is styled and inert, so an imported note can
  never turn into a launcher.
- **Drag to reorder.** Drag a tab up or down and the others step aside to show
  where it will land.
- **Pull a note anywhere.** Grab the open note by its tab-gutter and drag it
  off the deck — it becomes a floating sticky wherever you drop it, draggable
  by its header, across displays, and resizable from any edge or corner. It
  remembers the size you stretch it to. Idle a minute and it tucks itself back to
  the edge, exactly like a note on the deck. Unpinned it stacks like any
  window — other windows can cover it; pin it and it stays on top and never
  tucks. One floats
  at a time — pulling out a second tucks the first.
- **Hide the deck completely.** Settings → Deck: nothing shows at rest — no
  pill, no dashes. The edge strip still wakes the tabs on hover. Off by
  default.
- **Pin a note to keep it open.** The pin in a note's header (or `⌘P`) stops it
  being dismissed by anything you did not aim at it — clicking away in another
  app, or leaving it idle. Esc and Close still close it. Pinned tabs carry a dot,
  and the pin is remembered.
- **Closing a note steps back to the deck.** Esc, Close, archiving or deleting
  leaves the tabs where they were; only moving away from the edge puts the deck
  back to sleep. Clicking in another app dismisses the whole thing.
- **Tidies itself away.** A fan left untouched collapses after 4 seconds; an open
  note after a minute idle.
- **Export** — Markdown (one `.md` per note), plain text (one `.txt` per note),
  a single document, or a `.stickies` archive that preserves colours, archived
  state and dates. **Import** reads `.stickies` back, and will also take loose
  `.md` / `.txt` files.
- Right-click the pill for the full menu: new note, windows, edge side, launch at
  login, export, import, quit.

## Your notes stay on your Mac

- Local SQLite database in `~/Library/Application Support/Noty/`.
- **Note bodies are encrypted with AES-GCM** (CryptoKit, 256-bit). Titles,
  colours and timestamps stay in plaintext so lists render without unsealing
  every row.
- No account, no server, no analytics, no telemetry, no tracking SDKs.
- **No in-app updater in this fork.** Homebrew downloads published releases when
  you request an installation or update.
- No Accessibility permission, no Screen Recording, no system permissions.

Verify it yourself:

```sh
sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Noty/notes.db "SELECT hex(substr(body,1,24)) FROM notes;"
strings ~/Library/Application\ Support/Noty/notes.db | grep "some text from a note body"   # finds nothing
```

## Build

Requires the Swift toolchain from Command Line Tools (**Xcode is not needed**)
and macOS 15+. Release builds produce a universal app for Apple Silicon and
Intel; debug builds target the current Mac. This fork distributes one universal
ZIP through Homebrew and does not include Sparkle.
```sh
./build.sh                   # release build → build/Noty.app
./build.sh debug             # fast, unoptimised
./build.sh release run       # build, then relaunch
./scripts/test-editor.sh     # focused editor range/style/input regression checks
open build/Noty.app
```

`build.sh` drives `swiftc` directly over `Sources/*.swift` for both supported
architectures, combines the resulting binaries with `lipo`, assembles the
`.app` bundle around `Info.plist`, embeds Sparkle, and signs it.

Sparkle is optional. Without `Sparkle/Sparkle.framework` the app still builds —
`Updater.swift` compiles to a stub and the update menu says so.

### Local font and theme customization

Settings → Notes now offers **Choose…** to open the macOS font panel, plus
**System** to reset the face. Choose any installed font; use the panel's
collection menu to select **All Fonts** if it is filtering by language.
The panel and text-size slider share the existing 10–30 pt setting.

**Theme** offers Follow macOS, Light, Dark (the default), Sepia, and Nord.
Changes apply immediately to open notes and previews. The eight note colors
keep their original identities in storage and exports; themes only change
how they are drawn. Follow macOS also responds to appearance changes while
Noty is running.

For this local fork, build with `./build.sh debug` without fetching Sparkle,
quit the installed Noty, then open `build/Noty.app`. This uses the existing
Noty preferences and `~/Library/Application Support/Noty/` data. Run only one
copy at a time. The installed application is not replaced by the build.

### Homebrew management and migration

The remote cask lives in this repository at `Casks/noty-local.rb`, and downloads
its universal ZIP from this repository's Releases. The installed app lives at
`/Applications/Noty.app`; it uses the original notes and preferences.

If you previously used the local-only `inurun/local/noty-local` cask, quit Noty
and migrate once:

```sh
brew uninstall --cask inurun/local/noty-local
brew untap inurun/local
brew tap inurun/noty https://github.com/inurun/noty.git
brew install --cask inurun/noty/noty-local
```

Uninstalling without `--zap` keeps notes and settings. Only untap the old local
tap if it contains no other packages. Remove it before installing the remote
cask to avoid ambiguities between the two copies of `noty-local`.

`./scripts/install-homebrew.sh` now installs or updates the **published** fork;
it no longer builds this checkout. Use `./build.sh debug` for unpublished local
changes. The old `package-homebrew.sh` remains available for preparing an
offline, native-architecture package; it does not publish or install anything.

### Releasing this fork

1. Commit and push the source changes to `main` after testing.
2. Update `RELEASE-NOTES.md` with the behavior shipped in the next release.
3. Run **Release personal fork** from GitHub Actions on this repository.

The manually triggered workflow tests the editor, builds an updater-free
universal app, and creates a UTC timestamp version (`YYYY.MM.DD.HHMMSS`).
It uploads a draft release, pushes the matching cask version and SHA-256 to
`main`, then publishes the release. Ordinary pushes do not publish releases.
No Sparkle signing secret or additional tap repository is required.

`./scripts/package-release.sh` can prepare the same ZIP and cask locally for
inspection. It does not commit, push, or publish. The default release tag is
`local-v<version>`, separate from upstream's tags. The package carries the
upstream base version 1.6.1 and a timestamp build number.

If publication fails, inspect the workflow log and any draft release before
retrying. If a cask commit was pushed but final publication failed, publish the
matching draft to make the archive available. Never replace a published ZIP
under the same version: prepare a new release with a new checksum instead.

## Layout

```
Sources/
  Main.swift            @main entry point; NSApplication, accessory policy
  AppDelegate.swift     wiring, actions, main menu
  Core.swift            Paths, AES-GCM Crypto, colour palette, Note model
  Store.swift           SQLite (C API) — schema, load, upsert, delete
  NoteStore.swift       observable model; the single source of truth
  Settings.swift        UserDefaults prefs + launch-at-login
  HotKeys.swift         Carbon global shortcuts (no permissions)
  DeckPanel.swift       geometry, NSPanel subclass, tracking container
  DeckController.swift  one deck per display + the state machine
  DeckViews.swift       pill, fan, tabs, the 45 ms stagger
  NoteEditor.swift      NSTextView bridge, find, 250 ms autosave
  LibraryWindow.swift   All Notes / Archive
  ExportImport.swift    md / txt / single file / .stickies
  UndoToast.swift       the ten-second undo after a delete
```

Four details worth knowing if you touch the deck:

- A borderless `.nonactivatingPanel` returns `false` from `canBecomeKey`, so the
  expanded note silently refuses keystrokes unless it is overridden.
- Views default `acceptsFirstMouse` to `false`, so the first click on a tab is
  otherwise eaten to activate the panel instead of opening the note — which is
  the *normal* case, since you are always in another app when you reach for the deck.
- The shingle relies on **ZStack declaration order**, not `zIndex`. Adding an
  explicit `zIndex` per tab reordered neighbouring tabs and broke the lap.
- `rotationEffect` is a render transform, not a layout one: a rotated label still
  measures at its unrotated width, so anything sized around one has to be
  constrained and clipped separately or it bleeds across the note.

Set `NOTY_DEBUG_DECK=1` in the environment to trace deck state transitions on stderr.

## Differences from the original

- **Not sandboxed**, so data lives in `~/Library/Application Support/Noty/`
  rather than `~/Library/Containers/`. Sandboxing needs a provisioning profile,
  which needs Xcode and a developer account.
- The AES key is a `0600` file beside the database. The Keychain is the right
  home for it in a distributed build, but an ad-hoc signature changes on every
  rebuild, which makes the Keychain re-prompt or deny each time.
- `.stickies` here is Noty's own JSON archive format — the original's is opaque,
  so the two are not interchangeable. This one round-trips its own exports with
  full fidelity.
- No licensing, trial, or update machinery.
- Ad-hoc signed and not notarised, so Gatekeeper will want a right-click → Open
  the first time if the app is moved off this machine.

## Licence

MIT — see [LICENSE](LICENSE). Do what you like with it; keep the copyright
notice.

The upstream build optionally bundles [Sparkle](https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle)
(also MIT) for updates; this fork’s Homebrew releases omit it. Its notice is reproduced in
[licenses/THIRD-PARTY.txt](licenses/THIRD-PARTY.txt) and copied into
`Noty.app/Contents/Resources/`, so it travels with every DMG as its licence
requires.
